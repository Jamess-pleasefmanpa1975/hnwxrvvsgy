Just walked out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Amateur, and I’m somewhere between confused and genuinely thrilled. Like when you order fries with a milkshake – and you're not quite sure if it's genius or just plain weird. I mean, this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 was something else. I'm tired, maybe even a bit annoyed (because my popcorn was a no-show today), but also kind of swept away by it all.

The Amateur isn't your run-of-the-mill   with slick characters and perfect pacing. Nope. It's more like that w𝘩𝘢𝘤𝘬y uncle who shows up at family gatherings – completely unpredictable and a little awkward, but somehow, you end up totally engrossed by his stories. The pacing is all over the place. At one moment, you’re knee-deep in drama, and the next, it’s like, wait, am I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a thriller? It's got that disjointed narrative, jumping from thought to thought, but not in a pretentious artsy way, more like an excited puppy running after its own tail. Hilarious.

> There’s this character, I won’t name names, but honestly, they’re the human equivalent of a mismatched sock – endearing in their oddness. They’re not polished or trying to win over anyone. And the dialogue... it’s like you’re eavesdropping on two strangers at a bus stop. Mostly nonsense, but then suddenly profound?

Going into it, I didn’t expect to feel this weird mix of emotions. Is it possible to be deeply moved and slightly annoyed at the same time? Because that’s where I’m at with it. And oh, the visuals! I swear, some shots are like trying to capture a sneeze with a camera. Blurry, unexpected, but it works. It actually works.

Here's a fun bit – at some point, random snippets of Python code flashed through my brain. You know, useless stuff like this:

```
def ponder_life(meaning):
    if meaning == True:
        return Confused but happy
    else:
        return Still confused
```

What the heck does that mean? No idea. But that's the kind of weirdness this   sparked. 

I wouldn’t say rush to the cinema, but definitely give it a whirl once it's available for 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 or 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮𝘪𝘯𝘨. It’s not about finding excellence but uncovering a singular mess of ideas that somehow manages to make sense in its own nonsensical way. I’m already replaying bits of it in my mind, and it’s kind of awesome when a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 lingers like that, like a song you didn’t really like at first but then it grows on you like fungus – in a good way, I guess?
